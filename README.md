# JavaScript Asynchronous Programming Assignment

## Overview
This assignment demonstrates various asynchronous programming techniques in JavaScript, including **Callbacks**, **Promises**, and **Async/Await**. Each technique is implemented with a simple button click event, data fetching from an external API, and proper UI/UX design using HTML and CSS.

## Features

### Callbacks
- A button triggers a callback function with a 5-second delay.
- A loading animation is shown during the delay.
- After 5 seconds, the message "Callback executed after 5 seconds" is displayed.
- Data from [JSONPlaceholder API](https://dummyjson.com/posts) is fetched and displayed in a well-structured container.

### Promises
- A button initiates a Promise that resolves after 5 seconds.
- A loading animation and message are displayed while the Promise is pending.
- After 5 seconds, the fetched data from [JSONPlaceholder API](https://dummyjson.com/posts) is displayed.

### Async/Await
- A button triggers an asynchronous function using the `async/await` syntax.
- A loading animation and message are shown during data fetching.
- The fetched data is displayed in a formatted container once the data is received.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshal1800/async-ass.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd async-ass
   ```

3. **Open the Files in a Browser:**
   - Open `callbacks.html`, `promises.html`, or `async-await.html` directly in any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

4. **Interact with the Buttons:**
   - Click the buttons to observe the respective asynchronous operations and data fetching in action.
